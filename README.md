If you are planning to purchase your dream home or car, you must be wondering how much money you can afford to repay without overburdening yourself. It depends on how much EMI (i.e., monthly payment) you can pay and for how long. If you have an idea about how much EMI you can pay every month, then it will be easier for you to know how much you can afford. Enter the amount of EMI that you can pay every month, the interest rate charged by your bank and the preferred tenure, the loan amount calculator will tell you how much you can afford to borrow.
